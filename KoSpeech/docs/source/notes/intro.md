`KoSpeech` is an End-to-End open source project for Korean speech recognition. The goal of this work is to help research speech recognition. It was developed with a focus on readability and extensibility of code. Learning is possible through various options such as feature extraction, attention mechanism, and data augmentation, etc..   
We used `KsponSpeech` corpus which containing **1000h** of Korean speech data. At present our model has recorded an **89.69%** character recognition rate. We are always updating this work for increased recognition rate and extensibility.   
We appreciate any kind of [feedback or contribution](https://github.com/sooftware/End-to-end-Speech-Recognition/issues).

## Intro
  
End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) is an emerging paradigm in the field of neural network-based speech recognition that offers multiple benefits. Traditional “hybrid” ASR systems, which are comprised of an acoustic model, language model, and pronunciation model, require separate training of these components, each of which can be complex.   
  
For example, training of an acoustic model is a multi-stage process of model training and time alignment between the speech acoustic feature sequence and output label sequence. In contrast, E2E ASR is a single integrated approach with a much simpler training pipeline with models that operate at low audio frame rates. This reduces the training time, decoding time, and allows joint optimization with downstream processing such as natural language understanding.

### KoSpeech
  
`kospeech` module has modularized and extensible components for las models, trainer, evaluator, checkpoints etc...   
In addition, `kospeech` enables learning in a variety of environments with a simple option setting.  
  
We are constantly updating the progress of the project on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/sooftware/End-to-end-Speech-Recognition/wiki).  Please check this page.  
  
## Installation
This project recommends Python 3.7 or higher.   
We recommend creating a new virtual environment for this project (using virtual env or conda).  

### Prerequisites
  
* Numpy: `pip install numpy` (Refer [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) for problem installing Numpy).
* Pytorch: Refer to [PyTorch website](http://pytorch.org/) to install the version w.r.t. your environment.   
* Pandas: `pip install pandas` (Refer [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) for problem installing Pandas)  
* Matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib` (Refer [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) for problem installing Matplotlib)
* librosa: `pip install librosa` (Refer [here](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) for problem installing librosa)
* torchaudio: `pip install torchaudio` (Refer [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) for problem installing torchaudio)
* tqdm: `pip install tqdm` (Refer [here](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) for problem installing tqdm)
  
### Install from source
Currently we only support installation from source code using setuptools. Checkout the source code and run the   
following commands:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
python bin/setup.py build
python bin/setup.py install
```
  
## Get Started
### Step 1: Data Preprocessing  
    
you can preprocess `KsponSpeech corpus` refer [wiki](https://github.com/sooftware/KoSpeech/wiki/Preparation-before-Training) or [this repo](https://github.com/sooftware/KsponSpeech-preprocess).       
This documentation contains information regarding the preprocessing of `KsponSpeech`.   

### Step 2: Run `main.py`
* Default setting  
```
$ ./run.sh
```
* Custom setting
```shell
python ./bin/main.py -batch_size 32 -num_workers 4 -num_epochs 20  -spec_augment
```
  
You can train the model by above command.  
 If you want to train by default setting, you can train by `Defaulting setting` command.   
 Or if you want to train by custom setting, you can designate hyperparameters by `Custom setting` command.

### Step 3: Run `eval.py`
* Default setting
```
$ ./eval.sh
```
* Custom setting
```
python ./bin/eval.py -dataset_path dataset_path -data_list_path data_list_path -mode eval
```
Now you have a model which you can use to predict on new data. We do this by running `greedy search` or `beam search`.  
Like training, you can choose between `Default setting` or `Custom setting`.  
  
### Checkpoints   
Checkpoints are organized by experiments and timestamps as shown in the following file structure.  
```
save_dir
+-- checkpoints
|  +-- YYYY_mm_dd_HH_MM_SS
   |  +-- trainer_states.pt
   |  +-- model.pt
```
You can resume and load from checkpoints.

For live discussions, please go to our [gitter](https://gitter.im/Korean-Speech-Recognition/community) or Contacts sh951011@gmail.com please.
  
We appreciate any kind of feedback or contribution.  Feel free to proceed with small issues like bug fixes, documentation improvement.  For major contributions and new features, please discuss with the collaborators in corresponding issues.  
  
## TODO List
  
* [X] Add Transformer model 
* [ ] Train with Transformer model
* [ ] Inference with Transformer model
* [ ] Add CTC with beam search (Connectionist Temporal Classification)
  
### Code Style
We follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for code style. Especially the style of docstrings is important to generate documentation.
